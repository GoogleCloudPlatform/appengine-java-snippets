<h1>Jetty9 GCloud Session Test Webapp</h1>
This webapp demonstrates the use of the GCloud session manager with an
application deployed on the pure Jetty9 GAE image.

The <a href="/dump/info">Dump Servlet</a> can be used to see both the instance and 
session used by each request.  You can add request query parameters to the URI to
set session attributes, which should then be seen of subsequent reloads, no matter
which instance is hit.
