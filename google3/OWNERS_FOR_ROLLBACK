# Anyone Senior Staff or above may request to be added to this file.
# Someone else here or in //OWNERS must recommend you.

# Use the people in this file to rollback to a known good build when the
# original authors and approvers can't be reached. If a change is smaller in
# scope, prefer using regular OWNERS for subtrees first.
#
# Follow the general guidelines in http://go/youbrokeme to communicate about
# the breakage. People are stressed when a large number of builds are broken
# or production stability is at risk; do what you can to help the problem get
# fixed quickly and safely and calmly.
