# Google Cloud API Showcase: Cloud BigQuery & StackDriver Monitoring in App Engine Standard Environment for Java 11

This API Showcase demonstrates how to run an AppEngine standard environment application with dependencies on both
[Google BigQuery][bigquery] and [StackDriver Monitoring][stackdriver].

[bigquery]: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs
[stackdriver]: https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/docs

The home page of this application provides a form to initiate a query of public data, in this case StackOverflow
questions tagged with `google-bigquery`.

The home page also provides a summary view of the metrics that have been logged in the past 30 days.

## Setup the Sample App

- Copy the sample apps to your local machine:
```
  git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/java-docs-samples
```

- Add the [appengine-simple-jetty-main](../README.md#appengine-simple-jetty-main)
Main class to your classpath:
```
  cd java-docs-samples/appengine-java11/appengine-simple-jetty-main
  mvn install
```

- Move into the `appengine-java11/bigquery` directory and compile the app:
```
  cd ../bigquery
  mvn package
```

## Setup you Google Cloud Project

- Make sure [`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/) is installed and initialized:
```
   gcloud init
```
- If this is the first time you are creating an App Engine project
```
   gcloud app create
```
- For local development, [set up][set-up] authentication
- Enable [BigQuery][bigquery-api] and [Monitoring][monitoring-api] APIs
- If you have not already enabled your project for StackDriver, do so by following [these instructions][stackdriver-setup].

[set-up]: https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started
[bigquery-api]: https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/google/bigquery-json.googleapis.com
[monitoring-api]: https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher/details/google/monitoring.googleapis.com
[stackdriver-setup]: https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/accounts/tiers#not-enabled

## Deploy

- Deploy to AppEngine standard environment using the following Maven command.
```
   mvn appengine:deploy -Dapp.deploy.projectId=<your-project-id>
```
- Direct your browser to `https://<your-project-id>.appspot.com`.
- View more in-depth metrics data on the [StackDriver Monitoring Dashboard][dashboard]

Note: The first time the app is run (or after any metrics definitions have
been deleted) it may take up to 5 minutes for the MetricDescriptors to sync
with StackDriver before any results are shown. If you do not see results,
please wait a few moments and try again.
