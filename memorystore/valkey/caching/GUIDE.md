**Build a Caching Service on Google Cloud using Valkey, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL**

Modern applications need to deliver fast, responsive user experiences at scale. Whether you're hosting an e-commerce storefront, running a real-time gaming backend, or providing dynamic content APIs, performance and reliability are key. One tried-and-true way to meet these demands is by adding a caching layer.

In this tutorial, we’ll walk through the architectural concepts and deployment steps for creating a high-performance caching service on Google Cloud. Using a combination of Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and [Valkey](https://github.com/invertase/valkey-demos), an in-memory key-value store with Redis-like interfaces, you can significantly reduce latency, offload your primary database, and deliver consistent, low-latency responses.

## Why Caching Matters

- **Speed & Latency:** Storing frequently requested data in memory avoids repeated round-trip queries to databases, slashing response times.
- **Scalability:** By easing the load on your primary database, caching allows you to handle more requests smoothly as traffic grows.
- **User Experience:** Faster responses translate into happier users, which is especially crucial for high-traffic or interactive applications such as gaming and e-commerce platforms.

**Common Use Cases:**

- **E-Commerce:** Quickly serve product catalogs, pricing details, and inventory counts.
- **Gaming:** Cache player stats, sessions, and game states for real-time gaming experiences.
- **API Gateways & Microservices:** Reduce downstream service calls by serving cached API responses.

## What You’ll Build

You’ll set up a caching service that:

1. **Works with a PostgreSQL database** to store long-lived, persistent records.
2. **Incorporates Valkey** as a high-speed, in-memory cache, fronting the PostgreSQL database.
3. **Uses Spring Boot** to expose REST endpoints, providing a simple interface for reading, writing, and invalidating cached data.
4. **Can be Dockerized and deployed to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for production, leveraging services like Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, and Memorystore.

By following this guide, you’ll have a reference architecture ready to adapt, test, and deploy to meet the performance needs of your application.

## Architecture Overview

The high-level architecture looks like this:

- **Spring Boot Application:** Serves as the middle tier, responding to API calls. It checks Valkey first for cached results; if not found, it retrieves data from PostgreSQL, then updates the cache.
- **Valkey (In-Memory Cache):** A Redis-like memory store that keeps hot data ready to be served instantly.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Your source of truth for all data. The cache reduces how often the app queries this database.
- **Google Cloud Infrastructure:** Deployed using Terraform, you can host the application on Cloud Run, store data in Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL, and leverage Memorystore for Valkey.

## Steps to Build

1. **Set Up Your Environment:**

   - Install Java 17 (or later), Maven, Docker, and Docker Compose locally.
   - Set up a GCP project, enabling Cloud Run, Memorystore, and Cloud SQL APIs if you plan to deploy to Google Cloud.

2. **Download the Example Code:**
   Instead of writing all the code from scratch, we’ve prepared a working demo repository that you can clone and explore. It includes everything you need—Spring Boot configuration, caching logic, Dockerfiles, and Terraform scripts for deployment.

   **Get the code here:**  
   [https://github.com/invertase/valkey-demos/tree/main/demos/cache](https://github.com/invertase/valkey-demos/tree/main/demos/cache)

3. **Review the Code Structure:**
   In the repository, you’ll find:

   - **Spring Boot project files:** Main application class, REST controllers, repository classes, and caching logic.
   - **Configuration files:** For JDBC (PostgreSQL) and Jedis (Valkey) clients, allowing flexible environment-based configurations.
   - **Terraform scripts (optional):** Infrastructure as Code templates to spin up resources on Google Cloud.

   The code is well-organized, with clear separation of concerns:

   - **Application Layer:** REST endpoints expose CRUD operations for cached data.
   - **Data Access Layer:** Repositories interact with PostgreSQL for persistent storage.
   - **Caching Layer:** A controller checks Valkey first and falls back to the database if needed.

4. **Customize the Configuration:**

   - Set your database URL, username, and password via environment variables or configuration files.
   - Point your VALKEY_HOST and VALKEY_PORT environment variables to your Valkey instance (in development, set it to localhost when running via Docker Compose).

5. **Run Locally with Docker Compose:**
   Use Docker Compose to start PostgreSQL, Valkey, and your Spring Boot app together. You’ll have a fully functional local environment that demonstrates how caching accelerates data retrieval.

   Simply run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   Once started, you can make GET, POST, and DELETE requests to the REST endpoints to store, retrieve, and invalidate cached data. Check the repository’s README for example commands and endpoints.

6. **Deploying to GCP (Optional):**
   With Terraform, you can provision:

   - **Cloud Run:** Runs your containerized Spring Boot application in a fully managed, serverless environment.
   - **Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL:** Provides a fully managed PostgreSQL instance.
   - **Memorystore (Valkey):** A fully managed Redis-compatible cache.

   Adjust the Terraform variables for your project, initialize Terraform, and apply the configuration. Once deployed, set up environment variables in Cloud Run to point to the appropriate instances.

   Visit the repository’s Terraform directory for detailed instructions and run:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```

   After Terraform finishes, you’ll have a production-ready caching architecture running in the cloud.

## Testing and Validation

- **Functional Tests:** Use `curl` or a tool like Postman to send requests to your deployed Cloud Run service. Ensure that reads are fast, and updates reflect in both the cache and database.
- **Load Testing:** Run load tests (e.g., with JMeter or Locust) to confirm performance gains. Compare response times with and without caching enabled.
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Integrate Google Cloud’s operations suite (formerly Stackdriver) to monitor query times, latency, and error rates, ensuring your caching strategy is delivering the intended benefits.

## Scaling and Optimization

As traffic increases, the architecture can scale horizontally:

- **Cloud Run** can automatically scale instances based on load.
- **Memorystore (Valkey)** can be sized or upgraded to handle more cached data or higher throughput.
- **Cloud SQL** can scale vertically or horizontally (with read replicas) as needed.

Fine-tune cache expiration strategies (TTL values) and eviction policies, depending on your data access patterns.

## Conclusion

By combining an in-memory store (Valkey) with a reliable database (PostgreSQL), all orchestrated by a Spring Boot application, you’ve built a caching solution that delivers high performance, reduces database load, and ensures an excellent user experience. Running it in Google Cloud extends these benefits further, providing managed services and easy scaling.
