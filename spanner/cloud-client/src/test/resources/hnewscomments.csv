By announcing that they were giving back money to their shareholders, they opened the door for savvy stock market gurus.  These guys milked it for all it was worth by first loading up on the stock in order to get the cash from the dividends.  Because all these people were buying the stock, its price became artificially inflated, so they proceeded to borrow against the stock at this point (in order to short-sell later).  Then the dividends came, and they got the $3/share from Microsoft.  Immediately after this, they proceeded to sell the stocks that got them the dividends, which led to the stock price falling sharply.  Finally, to round it all out, they proceeded to make good on the short-sells once the stocks were low, leading to a nice profit all-around.<p>I wish I remembered where I read about this scheme; it sounded pretty brilliant to me.

The reason I am posting this here is: I had such high hopes for you to be a different kind of corporation. - to be able to make the transition from cool startup to cool company. - not to be evil ;-). That's not how I see you now.<p>First of all, how and why does a company that was started by two guys without a PhD so strongly favorise PhDs when it comes to the recruitement for all research and other ""cool"" positions. I am halfway through on my own PhD in CS, and  honestly I just don't see your point. I mean a PhD is not a magical transformation into a creativity boasting super- hack-thing. Au contraire, I wonder how you are able to keep your engine running with so many PhDs around. There is some truth to the stereotype of the slightly mad and sometimes overly complicated CS academic person. I experience that daily. And then statements like: ""We want to hire people who are smarter than those already working for us"". Just hire people that have amazing skills, are cool, and enthusiastic. That's what you were built on. Please don't just look at GPA and titles.<p>Second and that applies not only to you but to all search engine companies, please stop giving us the impression that you know what's going on with your algorithm. Come on there are billions of documents on the Web - and you have an algorithm that ranks those according to millions of different queries. So please tell me - how do you figure out if your algorithm is doing it's job? How? It's all educated guessing. Nothing more. <p>Third, please G get over it with the ""Do not be evil thing"". AOL might have had an employee unfortunately release a dataset, but at least they allow you to delete all your personal data. While you do not, and boast about   anonymizing our data after several years. And yes you censor in China, and I also remember the story about your employee who you fired for blogging that you are actually not as cool as he imagined you. Yahoo and MS do stuff like this too, but at least they don't pretend to be saints.<p>And fourth. Please your marketing hype about being different, being still like a startup - you overplay it. You going green, and the sudden popularity of that - a mere coincidence? And yes - sue microsoft for being monopolistic - but at the same time acquire doubleclick and argue it's ok?<p>Ah, dear G. it might just be that I worked too much and yes I only slept 6 hours in the last three days. Dear G. above all - just stop pretending to be something else.

They are absolutely the kings of hot-fixes/service packs and absolutely the kings of keeping backwards compatibility wherever possible, which is about all you can ask for.<p>2) Let's not pretend like Internet Explorer wasn't a huge product for Microsoft (and the world). There's nothing worth arguing there. As for the web 2.0 stuff, Microsoft has demonstrated that it's not going to be a pioneer here (and it isn't in many businesses, actually). That said, they're making money from their search product, and MSN/Live.com is still quite popular. I don't know what metrics you want to judge Microsoft by here, but if they're behind it's not to the point of death. Especially since we still haven't seen any billion-dollar ideas out of web 2.0 (short of ad platform stuff a la Google, whic MSFT is copying).<p>3) When has Microsoft really had that many friends in the first place? They run a business that's especially large, so they'll be stepping on toes all over the place. I'm not entirely sure how this points to their ultimate demise, so long as they're still making more money than the competition is... (That means they're winning)<p>4) You only need one cash cow (ask Google). Microsoft has two clear clear money winners. The rest of the products are ultimately investments more than anything, but I'll go one by one just for fun. MSN is indeed taking over web search share recently, and has always had a super popular destination page and email. The Zune didn't beat the iPod, but neither is anything else. For a first try, the Zune actually didn't suck too hard. Microsoft is working their way into the consumer entertainment space here, though, is the real point. The surface computer isn't a real product, so I don't think anyone's bought it. MS research kicks out a lot of stuff that's just worth thinking about, not worth making. IIS is a pretty popular web server. It's not free though, so Apache makes for pretty tough competition. Ultimately, IIS is more a part of MS's entire web stack, and so if you buy into that, you're giving MSFT a lot of money, which is good, even if it's not #1. The Xbox, again, is a consumer entertainment play, and the Xbox 360's killing it in the US console market. Microsoft has a lot of money, and they throw it around. You don't have to win markets to make money, and they know that fact well.<p>5) It's way too early to tell for sure, but if XP's launch is any basis for comparison, Vista has some great years ahead. We'll see how the Vista hate keeps up when people realize it's, like XP is now, the standard OS everyone's running. Even if Mac OS tripled up, its share would still be basically irrelevant to MSFT's bottom line.<p>6) Compare Microsoft's stock price to Ford's over the last few years. Both companies are such long-standing giants that there's no excitement to be had in trading the stock. If you don't buy that, you could at least accept that if confidence in Microsoft were tanking, the stock would be too. It's actually up 10% on the year. <p>7) PC makers aren't turning their backs on Microsoft. They're trying to pick up some sales from the Microsoft haters (who they would prefer not also become Dell haters by association). Dell is gaining customers with the deal, and Microsoft's not losing any (since Dell buys the licenses, not the buyer). This is as much of a non-point as the rest.","1188801575","2007-09-03T06:39:35Z"

The dude is wrong. <p>By the way, isn't anyone else tired of this endless ""shift to services"" BS that we've been fed by tech-media since around year 2000? And even if it's a ""shift"" indeed, as opposed to just another possible option, isn't Microsoft in the best position to simply start charging everybody $XX/mo for Vista subscription? <p>Microsoft does have its problems, but they certainly have nothing to do with their business model or ""lack of friends"". As much as I dislike their products these days, nobody else managed to charge people for software as much as they did (and still do). Almost everybody else, having failed to produce something valuable enough to have users pay them money, is busy deciding on the same lame question: ""shall we put the ads up or we still have enough cash to wait until someone acquires us?"" The business is simple: make something people want and they will pay you. Either up front or monthly - is it really that important?<p>Every point he makes is either invalid or plain stupid. How can one say that ""Microsoft is doomed because their stock isn't rising anymore""? He is confusing a reason with consequence.
