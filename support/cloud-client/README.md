# Getting Started with Cloud Support API (v2)

## Prerequisites

You will first need to enable Cloud Support API and have all the prerequisites completed as outlined in the Process overview [here](https://cloud.google.com/support/docs/reference/v1#process-overview). This includes having a support-enabled GCP account, a GCP project with the Cloud Support API turned on, and a service account. 


## Using the code sample
Before running any code sample, you must first ensure you have Application Default Credentials set up by setting the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to point to the path where your service account's private key file lives. 

Then, you can view Starter.java code to see how to initialize and get started with the Cloud Support API (v2). Other provided Java classes show the main functionalities of the Cloud Support API (v2), but be sure to resolve all parts marked as TODO before running the code.

You may run the test suite with the command 'mvn test'
